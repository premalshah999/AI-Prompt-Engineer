⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
   
2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
cd backend
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the backend directory with your DeepSeek API key and authorized API keys:

text

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

AUTHORIZED_API_KEYS=your_secure_api_key_here

DEEPSEEK_API_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions

Run the backend server locally:


bash

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

Your backend is now running at http://localhost:8000.

3. Frontend Setup
4. 
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash

cd ../frontend

Open index.html directly in your browser or use a local development server like Live Server in VSCode.

Ensure your frontend JavaScript (script.js) points correctly to your local backend URL (http://localhost:8000/enhance).


🧪 Testing the Application Locally


Open the frontend (index.html) in your browser.


Enter a prompt in the provided input field.


Select the domain, style, and response length.


Click "Submit" to generate a sensational enhanced prompt.


The enhanced prompt generated by your backend (powered by DeepSeek API) will appear on your webpage.


🚀 Deployment Guide


Deploy Backend (Recommended)


You can deploy the backend using platforms such as:


Vercel


AWS Elastic Beanstalk


Google Cloud Run


Example Dockerfile for deployment:


text


FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

Build & Deploy Docker Container:


bash
docker build -t prompt-engineer-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 prompt-engineer-backend
Deploy Frontend (Recommended)
Deploy your frontend easily using services like:

Vercel

GitHub Pages

Netlify

After deployment, update script.js fetch URL with your deployed backend URL.

📊 Monitoring & Analytics
Your backend comes integrated with Prometheus metrics available at:

text
http://localhost:8001/
Metrics include:

Total API requests (requests_total)

Response latency (response_latency_seconds)

🔐 Security Recommendations
For production deployments:

Use secure HTTPS connections.

Restrict allowed origins in CORS middleware.

Regularly rotate and securely store your API keys.
